# Exchange

Some organizations choose to back their tokens with ETH. This means token holders can use the **CryptoTrophy Exchange** to redeem their tokens for a proportional amount of Ethereum.

The exchange rate is calculated as:

`rate = total supply / remaining ETH backing`

- **Total Supply:** The total number of tokens currently in circulation.
- **Backing ETH:** The amount of ETH held by the token contract.

This means that for each token, you will receive an amount of ETH according to the current ratio of tokens to ETH held by the contract.

Whenever you swap tokens for ETH, both the number of tokens and the ETH in the contract decrease proportionally. This keeps the exchange rate consistent for everyone.

## How the Exchange Works

- **View Your Balance:**  
  See your available token balances for each organization on the Exchange page.

- **Swap Tokens:**  
  Select the tokens you wish to exchange for ETH.

- **Confirm and Complete:**  
  Approve the transaction in your wallet to finalize the exchange. The ETH will be sent directly to your wallet.

## Important Notes

- **Exchange rates can vary:**  
  Each organization may have a different rate, based on their own token supply and ETH backing.
- **ETH swaps are organization-dependent:**  
  Not all organizations offer ETH redemption. This feature is only available if the organization has enabled it.
- **Blockchain security:**  
  All exchanges are executed on-chain, making them secure and fully transparent.

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**  
> Always review the current exchange rate before swapping to make sure youâ€™re getting the best value for your tokens.
