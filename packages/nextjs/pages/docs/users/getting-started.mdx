## Participate With a Wallet

To take part in challenges, claim rewards, or make exchanges, you’ll need to **connect a crypto wallet** (like MetaMask or another supported wallet).

- **ETH is required to pay for gas fees:**  
  Make sure your wallet has a small amount of Ethereum (ETH) to cover transaction fees when participating or claiming rewards.
- **No registration needed for most organizations:**  
  In most cases, connecting your wallet is all you need.
- **Some organizations may require extra registration:**  
  Certain organizations might have external systems that require you to register or verify your identity before you can claim specific challenges or rewards.

## Important Information About Prize NFTs

- **Check the organization’s official policy:**  
  Before buying a Prize NFT on a secondary market, always visit the issuing organization’s official page to understand the terms for exchanging the NFT for a real product or service.
- **Requirements may vary:**  
  Some organizations may require you to register, accept specific terms, or complete extra steps before you can redeem the NFT. In some cases, redemption may not be possible.
- **Read the fine print:**  
  Each organization sets its own rules for how and when NFTs can be redeemed. These terms are outside the control of the platform.
- **Buy only from trusted sources:**  
  If the organization does not provide clear, trustworthy information through an official channel, do not purchase their NFTs or tokens.
- **Platform limitation:**  
  The platform is not responsible for the redemption conditions or fulfillment of prizes by organizations.
