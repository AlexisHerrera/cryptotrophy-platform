# Prizes

Redeem your tokens for exciting real-world prizes, services, or exclusive experiences through the Prize Center!

## Exploring the Prize Center

- The **Prize Center** lets you browse all the rewards an organization offers and see how many tokens you need to redeem each one.
- You’ll also see your current token balance for that organization, so you can easily track what prizes you can claim.
- Use the search tool to quickly find the prizes that interest you.

## Prize Availability and Stock

- Prizes that are out of stock are automatically hidden from view. However, you can choose to show or search for out-of-stock prizes if you want to see everything that’s been offered.
- When redeeming, you can request more than one unit of a prize (as long as there is enough stock and you have enough tokens).

## Important Notes on Prizes

- **ETH for Gas Fees:**  
  You’ll need a small amount of ETH in your wallet to cover gas fees when redeeming a prize. Please ensure your wallet is funded before starting the redemption process.

- **Redemption Is Final:**  
  Once you exchange your tokens for a prize, the transaction is permanent and cannot be reversed. Double-check your selection and all prize details before confirming your redemption.

- **Possible Extra Registration:**  
  Some organizations may require additional registration or identity verification through their own systems before you can claim certain prizes or rewards.

- **Check Organization Policies and Requirements:**  
  Always review the official policies and requirements of the organization before redeeming a prize. If you do not meet specific requirements—such as geographic restrictions or eligibility criteria—you may not be able to receive the product or service, even if you own the NFT. Make sure you fully understand all terms before proceeding.
