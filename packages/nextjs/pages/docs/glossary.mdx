## Organization

An entity (such as a company) that joins the platform to manage its own points system and create custom challenges for users.

---

## Organization Points / Tokens

The unique token issued by an organization that represents user points. Optionally, these tokens can be backed by an ETH vault, giving them underlying value.

---

## Challenge

## Token Owner / User

A customer or end-user who participates in challenges or holds tokens issued by an organization. Both terms are used interchangeably.

---

## Loot

## Ponder

The real-time blockchain event indexer used to monitor smart contract activity and enable fast, searchable access to historical and live data.

---

## Circuits

Refers to the zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) circuits, built with tools like Circom, that enable privacy-preserving challenge validation (e.g., Secret Codes Validator).

---

## Hardhat

A development environment and framework for deploying and testing smart contracts used within the CryptoTrophy project.

---

## Next.js

The web application framework powering the CryptoTrophy frontend and backoffice user interfaces.
