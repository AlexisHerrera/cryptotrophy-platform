## Known Limitations & Planned Improvements

The following improvements are planned before CryptoTrophy is production-ready:

- **Security Enhancements:**  
  We plan to strengthen smart contract security. All contracts should undergo a professional security audit.

- **Backoffice Features:**  
  The admin dashboard needs improved workflows, increased flexibility, and more control for organizations over challenges and rewards.

- **Web Interface Improvements:**  
  We're working to enhance the user experience and accessibility, and to make the platform responsive across devices.

- **Deployment Scripts:**  
  Deployment processes will be simplified and made more robust to better manage different environments and updates.

- **Integration Test Automation:**  
  We plan to implement and automate integration tests to ensure quality and proper system functioning.

- **Load Testing:**  
  Planned load testing will help us evaluate the app's performance and scalability under higher user volumes.
