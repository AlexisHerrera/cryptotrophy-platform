# Validators

**Validators** make sure that only eligible users can win challenges and receive tokens.  
Think of them as the digital referees for your competitions!

## What is a Validator and Why Does it Matter?

A **validator** is a key part of your challenge: it checks whether a user has actually completed the requirements and is eligible for rewards. Validators ensure that only the right users receive loot, making the process fair and trustworthy.

**Why are validators important?**
- Ensure fairness and trust in your campaigns.
- Make sure only qualified users can claim rewards.
- Automate the entire process—no manual checking required!

Validators make your challenges secure, efficient, and credible for both your organization and your users.

## Custom Validator

The **Custom Validator** feature allows your organization to deploy its own smart contract and use it as a validator within the platform.

**Why choose a Custom Validator?**
- **Maximum flexibility:** Build any validation logic your business needs.
- **Seamless integration:** Connect with your existing systems, data sources, or advanced on-chain workflows.
- **Full control:** Tailor challenges to unique requirements beyond the standard options.

To use a custom validator, your contract must follow the interface expected by the platform’s ChallengeManager.

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> Setting up a custom validator requires smart contract development. This option is recommended for organizations with dedicated technical teams or specialized use cases.


### Custom Validator Parameters

When configuring your custom validator, you’ll need:
- **Contract address:** Where your validator contract is deployed.
- **validatorUID:** A unique identifier for your validator and its version.
- **ABI Parameters:**  
  A list of values passed to your contract during setup, in the order the contract expects. Supported types: `string`, `address`, and `uint256`.

For more technical details, see the [Custom Validator Technical Guide](../technical/custom-validator).


For example, you can configure the contract used by the random validator directly through the custom validator interface:

Once set up, your custom challenge is managed just like those created using the built-in validator UI options.
