# Secret Codes Validator

The **Secret Codes Validator** allows you to reward customers who receive a special codeâ€”whether itâ€™s after winning a competition, making a purchase, or attending an exclusive event. This validator drives engagement and ensures that rewards go directly to your most valued participants, creating memorable and secure brand experiences.

This mechanism uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to let users prove they possess a valid code **without ever revealing the code on the blockchain**. This ensures both privacy and security for your organization and your users.

## How to Configure the Secret Codes Validator

1. **Set the number of codes:**  
   Choose how many unique secret codes you want to generate (for example, `N` codes).
2. **Automatic code generation:**  
   The platform will generate `N` pseudo-random secret codes for your campaign or event.
3. **Hash calculation:**  
   Each code is hashed using the Poseidon cryptographic hash function.
4. **Store hashes on-chain:**  
   Only the hashes (never the codes themselves) are stored in the smart contract, keeping your codes secure.

## How Users Claim Rewards

1. **User receives a secret code:**  
   After winning or participating in an event, the user receives a unique code from your organization.
2. **User enters their code:**  
   To claim their reward, the user enters the code into the platformâ€™s interface.
3. **Local hash calculation:**  
   The code is hashed locally (on the userâ€™s device), ensuring the secret code is never sent over the internet or stored on-chain.
4. **Hash verification:**  
   The platform checks if the hash matches one of the valid hashes stored in the smart contract.
5. **Zero-Knowledge Proof generation:**  
   The userâ€™s device generates a Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) to prove that they know a valid code, without revealing the code itself.
6. **Submit claim:**  
   The user submits the generated proof by calling the `claimReward` method on the smart contract.
7. **Reward distribution:**  
   - If the proof is valid, the contract records that the code was used and distributes the reward tokens to the user.
   - Each code can only be used once, preventing double-claims.
