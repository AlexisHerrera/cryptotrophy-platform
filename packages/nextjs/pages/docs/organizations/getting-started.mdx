## 1. Register Your Organization

To get started, open the **Organization Portal** from the project main page and click **Create organization**.

1. **Fill in your company details**  
   ![Organization registration form](/images/createorganizationprops.webp)

   - **Name:** Your organization’s name as it will appear to users.
   - **Resource:** This field connects your organization to its visual and informational assets (see below for details).
   - **Administrators:** Add one or more admin accounts that will manage your organization.

   > ⚠️ **Important:** Not even CryptoTrophy administrators can modify or access your organization's configuration or tokens. This guarantees full autonomy and ownership for your organization. **Be sure to securely store your admin account credentials. If you lose access, it cannot be recovered by CryptoTrophy.**

2. **Set up your organization token**
   - Define your token’s **name** and **symbol**.
   - *(Optional)* Add ETH to your vault to give real value to your points.

3. **Review and confirm**
   - Double-check all information, then confirm to complete your organization’s registration.

### Understanding the "Resource" Field

The **Resource** field determines how your organization’s images and public information are displayed to users. There are three supported options:

1. **Upload an image**  
   Upload an image file directly. This image will be stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and displayed when users view your organization.

2. **Link to an image**  
   Provide a direct link to an image hosted on your own backend. The image will be shown to users in the same way.

3. **Link to an organization resource (recommended)**  
   Provide a link to a folder (resource) containing a `metadata.json` file and any additional assets (e.g., logo). This is the recommended method, as it allows you to supply richer information about your organization. The `metadata.json` can include a description, logo, website, and social media links.

   **Example `metadata.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "description": "We have the best burgers in the world.",
     "logo": "https://yourcdn.com/orgs/bestburger/Logo.webp",
     "website": "https://thebestburger.com",
     "socials": {
       "twitter": "https://twitter.com/thebestburger"
     }
   }

## 2. Administrate Your Organization

Once your organization is created, you can manage it using the **Organization Console**.

From the console, administrators can:

- **Mint tokens**: Create new tokens for your organization.
- **Fund tokens**: Add value (ETH) to back your tokens.
- **Manage admin accounts**: Add or remove organization administrators.
- Manage prizes and challenges (see the following sections for details).

---

### Manage Admin Accounts

To add a new administrator to your organization:

1. Go to the **Admin Panel** in the Organization Console.
2. Enter the new administrator’s account address.
3. Click **Add Administrator**.

This grants the new account full admin privileges for your organization.

---

### Fund Tokens

Funding tokens gives real value to your organization’s points by backing them with ETH.

- Enter the amount you wish to fund **in ETH**.
- Click the asterisk (`*`) button next to the field.  
- The platform will automatically convert the ETH value to **wei** (the smallest unit of ETH, used by smart contracts).

> 💡 **Tip:** Funding tokens increases user confidence, as points have a real, redeemable value.

---

### Mint Tokens

Minting creates new tokens for your organization. These tokens can then be used to fund challenges or rewards.

- Newly minted tokens become available in your organization’s treasury.
- **Note:** If tokens are not backed by funding (ETH), their perceived value may decrease over time. For best results, mint tokens as needed and ensure there is sufficient funding.

You can also manage prizes and challenges from the console. See the following sections for more details.
