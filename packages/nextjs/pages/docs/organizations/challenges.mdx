# Challenges

Challenges are the heart of your program—they’re fun tasks, events, or competitions that get your users excited and engaged.

## Creating a Challenge

Set up engaging challenges for your users and reward them for participation. Follow these steps to create a new challenge for your organization:

---

### Step 1: Challenge Details

Fill out the fields on the first page:
![Organization registration form](/images/createchallengepage1.webp)

- **Challenge Description:**  
  Clearly describe your challenge. You can use Markdown to enhance your description—add links, lists, or images for a richer user experience.  
  *Tip:* We recommend including a link to a page with detailed challenge information and legal terms or conditions, so users know exactly what to expect.

- **Number of Tokens per Winner:**  
  Set the amount of tokens each winner receives.  
  *Example:* If each winner gets `10` tokens and you allow a maximum of `3` winners, the contract will reserve `30` tokens.

- **Maximum Number of Winners:**  
  Define how many unique winners the challenge can have.  
  *Note:* Each account can only win the challenge once.

- **Start Date:**  
  Set when the challenge becomes active.

- **End Date:**  
  Set when the challenge ends. After this date, no more claims will be accepted.

### Step 2: Validator Configuration

Choose how winners will be validated. You can define custom validators, or use one of the following flexible options provided by the platform:

- **Secret Codes Validator (On-Chain with ZKP):**  
  Use zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) for on-chain validation. This is secure, private, and ideal for secret code challenges.

- **Off-Chain API Validator:**  
  Use oracles to connect with external systems or databases. This ensures that only eligible users (e.g., verified in your backend) can win.

- **Randomized Validator:**  
  Winners are selected randomly, perfect for raffles or sweepstakes.

- **Custom Validator:**  
  Build your own logic to fit special requirements.

See the [Validator](/docs/organizations/validators) section.

### Step 3: Review and Confirm

Carefully review all the information you’ve entered:

- Double-check the challenge description and configuration.
- Verify the number of tokens and winners.
- Confirm the validator setup and challenge dates.

When you are ready, confirm to create your challenge. The system will reserve the necessary tokens and configure the challenge as specified.

## Managing Challenges

If you encounter an issue during a challenge or need to correct a mistake made during setup, you can edit the associated validator.

To make changes, simply return to the challenge management page. The same interface used for creating a validator is also used for editing it.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Changes to validators may affect how winners are selected or rewards are distributed. Always double-check updates before confirming your changes.
