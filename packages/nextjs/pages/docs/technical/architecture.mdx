# Architecture

Our application architecture follows a robust, modular approach inspired by best practices in modern Web3 platforms. This design balances scalability, usability, and cost-efficiency for both organizations and end-users.

## Main Components

### 1. User Presentation Layer

The user interface enables platform users to:

- Browse and discover organizations and active challenges.
- Claim tokens after completing challengesâ€”either by submitting proof or marking challenges as complete, pending organization validation.
- Redeem your tokens for prizes offered by the organization.

### 2. Organization Presentation Layer

This is the dedicated interface for organizations and administrators, providing features to:

- Create and manage challenges and campaigns.
- Configure reward tokens and validator logic (manual, automated, or random validation).
- Manage the Prize Center for redeemable goods or services.

### 3. Smart Contracts / dApp Logic

Smart contracts are the backbone of the application and encapsulate core business logic, including:

- Tracking organizations, challenges, tokens, and prizes.
- Verifying challenge completion, both on-chain and off-chain.

> **Note:** To minimize transaction costs and waiting times, all contracts are deployed on a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain.

### 4. Oracles

We leverage [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) oracles to power flexible and secure challenge validation:

- **Off-chain Validators:** Communicate with organization systems to confirm user eligibility or challenge completion before distributing rewards.
- **Random Validators:** Provide secure, provable randomness (e.g., for selecting random winners), which blockchains cannot natively generate due to their deterministic nature.

### 5. Storage

Storing data directly on-chain is expensive. To address this, we use decentralized storage solutions like [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) for non-critical data:

- IPFS offers decentralized, scalable storage for assets such as images and challenge metadata.
- Organizations upload metadata and images to IPFS, which enhances user experience without incurring high blockchain storage costs.

### 6. Event Indexing

Certain operations (e.g., full-text search) are not practical or efficient to perform directly on-chain or in the frontend.

- We use an event indexing tool [Ponder](https://ponder.sh/) to listen to blockchain events and maintain an off-chain, searchable relational database.
- The indexer configuration specifies which events to track and how to map blockchain data to database records.
- This setup keeps the off-chain database synchronized with blockchain events in near real-time.

### 7. Project Website

Our project website is built as a:

- Comprehensive documentation for all user roles.
- Clean, intuitive UI for both end-users and developers.
- Streamlined onboarding for third-party developers and integration partners.

## Why Two Independent Frontends?

We intentionally built **separate frontends** for end-users and organizations. This architectural choice enables us to:

- **Serve distinct audiences:** Organizations need powerful admin tools for challenge and reward management, while end-users benefit from a streamlined, discovery-focused interface.
- **Optimize for specific requirements:** Each frontend addresses different scalability, usability, and interface needs.
- **Accelerate development:** Specialized frontends allowed us to deliver targeted functionality faster and more efficiently than a unified, overly complex system.

**Summary:**  
- **User Frontend:** Prioritizes intuitive navigation, simplicity, and fast challenge discovery.
- **Organization Backoffice:** Tailored for administrators, streamlining the creation and management of challenges, rewards, and tokens.
