## Challenges

The process of creating a challenge in CryptoTrophy involves multiple contracts and data structures.

### Challenge Lifecycle & Management

All challenges are managed within a single smart contract called `ChallengeManager`. This contract controls the challenge lifecycle and provides the core functions—such as `claimReward`—that power user interactions.

Key points:

- **Every challenge belongs to exactly one organization** and is identified by a unique `uint256` ID (unique even across organizations).
- When creating a challenge, the organization ID is passed as a parameter.  
  Before creating the challenge, the `IOrganizationManager` interface checks that the sender is a registered admin of the relevant organization.

### Challenge Properties

When creating a challenge, several properties define its behavior:

- **Reward Amount:** The number of tokens awarded to the user.
- **Active Period:** The timeframe during which the challenge is open for claims.
- **Max Claims:** The maximum number of users who can claim rewards from this challenge.

### Assigning a Validator

Each challenge must have an assigned *validator*. The validator ensures that users have met the criteria to claim a reward. Three key parameters define the validator:

- `validatorUID`: A unique identifier for the contract that executes the validation logic. It indicates the validator type (on-chain, off-chain, etc.) and version.
- `validatorAddress`: The contract address used for validation.
- `validationId`: A `uint256` integer that uniquely identifies a validation instance. This is used to track the specific configuration associated with a challenge.

#### Validator vs. Validation Instance

It’s important to distinguish between a **validator** (`validatorUID`) and a **validation instance** (`validationId`):

- **Validator (`validatorUID`):** Refers to the contract containing the validation logic (e.g., an on-chain validator running ZKP code or an off-chain validator calling an external API).
- **Validation Instance (`validationId`):** Refers to a specific configuration for that validator. For example, two organizations may use the same off-chain validator contract but require different API endpoints. Instead of deploying multiple validator contracts, each organization assigns its own `validationId` and configuration (such as a URL) within the validator contract.

This approach enables flexibility:  
- Each validator contract can store multiple configurations indexed by `validationId`.  
- When a challenge triggers validation, the contract uses the `validationId` to look up the correct settings (e.g., the right API URL).

**Security Note:**  
The `validationId` is defined and stored by the organization at challenge creation and cannot be modified by the user. This ensures users cannot tamper with validator configurations (such as changing the target URL).

### Benefits of the `validationId` System

- Makes the platform modular and extensible.
- Allows organizations to add new validation logic without redeploying core contracts or duplicating validator contracts.
- Keeps validator configuration secure and isolated to each organization and challenge.
