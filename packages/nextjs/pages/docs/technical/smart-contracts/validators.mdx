## Validators

Validators in CryptoTrophy are designed to be **completely independent** from both organizations and challenges. This modularity allows validators to be reused in other contexts and applications with minimal changes.

### Decoupling Validators

To achieve this high level of decoupling, two key interfaces were defined:

- **`IValidator`:**  
  Every validator contract must implement this interface. By adhering to a common standard, new types of validators can be introduced at any time—without requiring a redeployment of the `ChallengeManager` contract. This makes the platform highly extensible and adaptable to new validation mechanisms (on-chain, off-chain, ZKP, API-based, etc.).

- **`IValidatorCallback`:**  
  This interface defines the callback mechanism that is triggered only if validation succeeds. The `ChallengeManager` contract implements this interface, ensuring that:
    - The challenge is claimed,
    - The appropriate tokens are transferred to the user's account.

This architecture ensures that validators remain generic and reusable, while the application logic (challenge claiming and token distribution) stays safely within the core platform contracts.

## Built-in Validator Mechanisms

While organizations are free to implement their own custom validators, CryptoTrophy provides several **flexible, ready-to-use validators out of the box** that cover a wide range of use cases:

- **Secret Codes (ZKP, On-chain):**  
  Uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to securely validate secret codes directly on-chain. This ensures the result is verifiable without exposing any sensitive information.

- **Off-chain Validation:**  
  Leverages oracles to connect the platform with external data sources (such as APIs or organizational systems). This enables verification of challenge completion based on off-chain events or criteria, while maintaining authenticity and integrity in the delivery of rewards.

- **Randomized Validation:**  
  Supports challenges where winners are selected at random. Uses secure randomness sources (such as Chainlink VRF) to ensure fairness and transparency.

- **Custom Validation:**  
  Organizations can develop and deploy their own validator contracts, enabling highly customized challenge conditions and validation logic tailored to specific business requirements.
