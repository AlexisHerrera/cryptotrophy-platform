## Deployment

Deploying CryptoTrophy involves several key components beyond just the smart contracts. 
As outlined in the architecture section, the deployment includes contracts, an indexer (Ponder), the frontend.


### Smart Contracts

Contracts can be deployed to several chains: Base, Base Sepolia an local network

For testing contracts were deployed to both **Base Sepolia** (emulating a production network) and to a local network using **Hardhat**.

- When deploying, you must configure the **Off-chain** and **Random** validators with the correct Chainlink contract addresses.
    - On Base Sepolia, use the addresses provided by Chainlink.
    - On local networks, mock contracts were created to simulate the Chainlink callback process. These mock contracts are deployed only in local environments.


### Frontend

The frontend is built with **Next.js** and deployed using **Vercel** for seamless and automated deployments.


### Indexer

For the indexer (Ponder), we used **AWS EC2** instances.

- Both services are managed with **Docker Compose**, which lists the backend, indexer, and a **Postgres** database service.
