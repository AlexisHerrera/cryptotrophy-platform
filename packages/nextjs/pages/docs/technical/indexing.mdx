## Ponder

**Ponder** is an open-source framework designed for custom Ethereum indexing. It lets you write TypeScript code to transform and organize on-chain data into your own database schema, enabling fast, flexible queries in your Web3 applications.

### Why Use Ponder?

- **Custom Indexing:** Transform smart contract events into structured data tailored to your app.
- **Flexible Queries:** Access your data using GraphQL, SQL over HTTP, or by querying Postgres directly.
- **Full Control:** You define the schema and logic for how on-chain data maps to your application's needs.

### How Ponder Works

1. **Define your schema** in TypeScript using `onchainTable`.
2. **Write event handlers** that listen for smart contract events, then process and store them in your database.
3. **Query your data** using GraphQL, SQL, or direct Postgres connections.

### Example: Indexing Organization Creation

Below is an example that shows how to index organization creation events from the blockchain and store them in a Postgres table:

```typescript
// 1. Define your table schema
export const organization = onchainTable("organization", (t) => ({
  id: t.text().primaryKey(), // orgId as string
  name: t.text(),
  token: t.text(),           // token address as text
  baseURI: t.text(),
}));

// 2. Handle contract events and insert data into Postgres
ponder.on("OrganizationManager:OrganizationCreated", async ({ event, context }) => {
  const { orgId, name, token, baseURI } = event.args;

  await context.db.insert(organization).values({
    id: orgId.toString(),
    name,
    token,
    baseURI
  });
});
