## Permissions

Carefully managing permissions is essential in any Web3 application. In CryptoTrophy, once an organization is created, **only accounts explicitly selected by that organization** can administer its contracts or settings.

Our platform is not fully trustless—it's a hybrid model. While users do need to trust the organization that issues tokens and manages challenges, the system is designed so that **no other organization, user, or even CryptoTrophy administrators** can interfere with an organization’s operations.

This approach ensures that:

- **Only the organization** has control over its token contracts and challenge management.
- The value of each token is determined solely by the issuing organization and its ongoing commitment to the community.
- User trust is preserved, since outside interference is technically and administratively prevented.

> By carefully isolating permissions, we protect organizational autonomy and reinforce the integrity of each organization’s reward system.
